Template for starting a React project with NextJS/Now

Easiest way to get started with React
1. Sign up for a [Now Account](https://zeit.co/now) (It's free!)
2. Start coding!

This template is based off of React Hooks and NextJS.
1. `pages` is where you will put the pages of your app in
2. `components` is where you will build out your components
3. `context` is where you can build context objects to pass down data to child components without [prop-drilling](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/prop-drilling)
4. `hooks` is where you can create stateful logic to use between your components

Tip: Don't use classes. That's so 2018
